        Returns an object which can return a list of the number of events that pass all the previous selections including the current one
        after each named selection is applied consecutively. The first element
        of the returned list is the total number of events before any selections are applied.

        Can also return a cutflow histogram as a ``hist.Hist`` object where the bin heights are the number of events of the cutflow list.
        If the PackedSelection is in delayed mode, the elements of the list will be dask_awkward Arrays that can be computed whenever the user wants.
        If the histogram is requested, those delayed arrays will be computed in the process in order to set the bin heights.
