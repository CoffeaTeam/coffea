    '''ABC for a generalized processor

    The various data delivery mechanisms (spark, striped, uproot, uproot+futures, condor, ...)
    receive such an object and the appropriate metadata to deliver dataframes to it.
    It is expected that the entire processor object can be serializable (check with `coffea.util.save`)
    No attempt should be made to track state inside an instance of ProcessorABC, it is to be
    treated simply as a bundle of methods.  The only exception is the read-only accumulator
    property.

    Examples
    --------

    A skeleton processor::

        from coffea import hist, processor

        class MyProcessor(processor.ProcessorABC):
            def __init__(self, flag=False):
                self._flag = flag
                self._accumulator = processor.dict_accumulator({
                    "sumw": processor.defaultdict_accumulator(float),
                })

            @property
            def accumulator(self):
                return self._accumulator

            def process(self, df):
                output = self.accumulator.identity()

                # ...

                return output

            def postprocess(self, accumulator):
                return accumulator

        p = MyProcessor()
